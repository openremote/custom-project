# Custom UI apps

In this folder, you can add custom (web) applications that will be shipped along with OpenRemote.  
For example, special mobile apps for a single use are very common.  
We make it easy for them to communicate with OpenRemote.

## Example apps

We provided several example apps to get familiar with the architecture.  
Here's a list of the apps, and what they do;

### /custom
This is an example web application built with Lit Web Components and Webpack.
Apps in our main OpenRemote repository are built with these technologies as well.
It can be used as a template to add your own pages on top of it.

### /custom-app-react
This is an example web application built with React 19 and RSPack.
